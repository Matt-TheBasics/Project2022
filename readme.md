# Project 2022 - Fora Donations Project

## by Coding Pack

Project goal was to write an application to make collections of donations easy, for both the end user as well as the client. 

Tracking was implemented with notifications, and all connected via the API to our array of tables that provided the applications with feedback.

This is a fairly dated revision of the project, as UJ holds copyrights to intellectual properties for it, so getting the full project is not available at this time.

I contributed to the front end and the API for this projects, bringing in Googles API for map tracking and distance tracking.
